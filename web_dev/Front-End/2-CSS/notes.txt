Tailwind CSS =>
- Create 'public/index.html' and 'src/main.css'
- Write following 3 lines in 'main.css' file =>
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

- 'npm init -y' (Initialize npm)
  -> this will add 'package.json' file to your project

- 'npx tailwindcss init' (to initialize tailwind)
  -> this will add 'tailwind.config.js' file to your project

- In 'tailwind.config.js', add "./public/*.html" to in 'content: []' (result => ' content: ["./public/*.html"] ')
  -> This means we are adding tailwind in all html files saved in public folder

- In 'package.json',
  change this =>
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  },

  to this =>
  "scripts": {
    "tailwind": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main.css -o ./public/css/styles.css --watch"
  },

  -> Remember '--watch' is must
  -> In place of 'tailwind' we can write anything but for convenience we have written 'tailwind'.
  -> This will create new file in as 'public/css/styles.css'
     and help to add require tailwind utility classes in 'styles.css'
     3 lines written in 'main.css' will help to add require tailwind utility classes

- 'npm run tailwind'
  -> run this command to keep track of classes.
     This will add require tailwind utility classes in 'styles.css'
     Keep this command running to automatically add that classes
